# hello-world

Hi, 
As of the time of this message, I am a graduate student working on developing my Java skills.
Hopefully, I can use this site to obtain helpful critiques/suggestions on how I can improve my code in the future.
In addition, if you are an employer in need of a junior developer and like my coding style, please feel free to contact me.  
Thank you!
